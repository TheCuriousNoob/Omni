# Omni

**Predicting the Future of Complex Systems**

---

## Overview

**Omni** is a next-generation AI designed for **simulation, reconstruction, and prediction of complex systems**.  

It leverages:  

- **Massive adversarial simulation engine**  
- **Structural inference from incomplete data**  
- **Signal/noise differentiation in dynamic environments**  

Omni can **reconstruct hidden structures, anticipate complex scenarios, and detect rare patterns**, even in dynamic and incomplete datasets.

## Conceptual Evolution Plan (0–10 years)

| Years | Milestone | Estimated Performance |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| 0–1 | Initial prototype; basic inferences on small datasets | Limited; high error rates |
| 2–3 | Continuous training, larger simulations, complex topology predictions | 20–30% accuracy |
| 4–5 | Adaptive learning, testing against sophisticated adversarial models | 50–60% accuracy |
| 6–7 | Multi-layer scaling, millions of nodes and data streams | 70–80% accuracy |
| 8–9 | Predictive AI, massive parallel simulations, detects rare patterns | 90–95% accuracy |
| 10 | Near 100% in controlled environments; limited only by absolute random noise and data uncertainty | ~99% accuracy |

> *Fundamental limits: absolute random noise, inherent data uncertainty, and physical factors impossible to fully simulate.*

## How Omni Works (High-Level Layers)

1. **Passive Data Collection**  
   Observes and aggregates existing data fragments without direct interference.

2. **Simulation Layer**  
   Creates millions of virtual environments, tests hypotheses and defensive moves; patterns that survive → likely real.

3. **Probabilistic Inference**  
   Reconstructs systems like a "brain in the shadows," estimating connections and weak points with high probability.

4. **Fragmented Action Layer**  
   Micro-actions are distributed; aggregated results provide complete visibility without leaving detectable traces.

**Why it appears invisible:** traces are distributed, below alert thresholds, and blend with normal system noise.
